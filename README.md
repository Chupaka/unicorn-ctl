## unicornctl - unicorn/rainbows control script

`unicornctl` is a simple and easy to use console tool for managing ruby applications using
[unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) or [rainbows](http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/) application servers.
The tool provides a set of reliable commands to start/stop/restart unicorn instances or upgrade them
without or with minimal downtime. `unicornctl` script could easily be used as a base for a startup
script for unix operating systems (see examples directory for a Redhat-style startup script example).

Please note, that this is still an alpha-quality software and it could have many issues. If you try it and
find any problems, feel free to report them using [Github Issues page](https://github.com/swiftype/unicorn-ctl/issues).
Pull requests are welcome too!

### Installation

The script comes packaged as a rubygem, so installation procedure is as simple as running the
following command:

    sudo gem install unicorn-ctl

After installation you should have an access to the `unicornctl` console command.

### Usage Instructions

Here is the help output from the `unicornctl` command:

```
Usage: unicornctl [options] <command>
Valid commands: start, stop, force-stop, restart, force-restart, upgrade
Options:
  --app-dir=dir                  | -d dir     Base directory for the application (required)
  --environment=name             | -e name    RACK_ENV to use for the app (default: development)
  --health-check-url=url         | -H url     Health check URL used to make sure the app has started
  --health-check-content=string  | -C string  Health check expected content (default: just check for HTTP 200 OK)
  --health-check-timeout=sec     | -T sec     Individual health check timeout (default: 5 sec)
  --timeout=sec                  | -t sec     Operation (start/stop/etc) timeout (default: 30 sec)
  --unicorn-config=file          | -c file    Unicorn config file to use, absolute or relative path (default: shared/unicorn.rb)
  --rackup-config=file           | -r file    Rackup config file to use, absolute or relative path (default: app-dir/config.ru)
  --pid-file=file                | -p file    PID-file unicorn is configured to use (default: shared/pids/unicorn.pid)
  --rainbows                     | -R         Use rainbows to start the app (default: use unicorn)
  --help                         | -h         This help
```

The following command are supported at the moment:

* `start` - starts a unicorn application and performs a health check if health check URL is available.
  If the server is already running, only the health check would be performed.
* `stop` - gracefully stops a unicorn application by sending a `QUIT` signal to the master process
  and waiting for a specified amount of time (30 sec by default) for the process and all of its
  children to shut down properly. If the process fails to stop in a given time, it is killed
  with a `KILL` signal.
* `force-stop` - forcefully shuts down a unicorn application by sending a `TERM` signal to it and
  waiting for the process to shut down quickly. If the process fails to stop in a given time, it is
  killed with a `KILL` signal.
* `restart` - gracefully shuts a unicorn application down and then starts it back up (performing a
  helth check if possible).
* `force-restart` - forcefully shuts a unicorn application down and then starts it back up
  (performing a helth check if possible).
* `upgrade` - zero or minimal downtime restart option for a unicorn application. Performs a set of
  steps to start a new copy of the application, test it and then gracefully shut down the old copy.
  If the graceful restart fails for any reason, the application is forcefully restarted.
* `reopen-logs` - Makes unicorn reopen its log files. This allows logrotate to rotate files atomically
  and quickly via rename instead of the racy and slow copytruncate method.
* `status` - Display current application server status. If the server is up, the command exits with exit
  code 0, otherwise the exit code will be 1.
